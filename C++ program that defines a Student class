/*Write a C++ program that defines a class called Student with the following private attributes:

name (a string to store the student's name)
age (an integer to store the student's age)
grade (a character to store the student's grade, e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C')
The Student class should have the following public methods:

A constructor that initializes the name, age, and grade attributes.
A method printInfo that prints the student's name, age, and grade to the console.
In your main function, create an instance of the Student class, set the attributes, and then call the printInfo method to display the student's information on the screen.

Write the C++ program to accomplish this task.*/
